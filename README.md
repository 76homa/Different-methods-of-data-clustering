# Different-methods-of-data-clustering
This time we want to use different methods for data clustering and measure them with different indexes to find which one is better for our data. 
When clustering data, we will definitely have the question of which method to use for clustering our data. There are different methods for this problem, such as K-means, Hierarchical, and DBSCAN.
But in order to find out which method is more suitable for our data, we can use different indexes such as Silhouette, Davies-Boulidin, and Within-duster sum of squares (WCSS).
The index Silhouette shows how much each member in a cluster is similar to other members of that cluster, the bigger the better!
The index Davies-Boulidin shows how similar the members of a group are to the members of other groups, the smaller the number, the better.
The last index shows the curve of the elbow.
According to the value of the given indices, you can find the optimal k.
